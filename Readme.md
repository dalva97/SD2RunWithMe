# RunWithMe

This project is an app that will record the distance and duration of miles ran to track progress. The
runner will need to carry a smart phone with them to track activity by inputting information to get reports. They will also need to modify the error logging path to match
their environment. Make sure to update the database to run Dbcontext.
The features in this app will include:
* A raw SQL query
* A log that records errors, invalid inputs, or other important events and writes them to a text file
* Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program
* Use a LINQ query to retrieve information from a data structure (such as a list or array) or file
